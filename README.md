- **Output**: To see Interactive Data Visualizations using Plotly and corresponding insights, [ðŸ‘‰ CLICK HERE ðŸ‘ˆ](https://nbviewer.org/github/chuandu2/music_therapy/blob/main/Insights_on_Data_Visualization.ipynb)

### Goal: 
- Investigate the relationship between different music-listening habits and mental conditions
- Explore whether the preferred music genres postively or negatively affect mental state
- Identify music genres that should be recommended for healing specific types of mental problems (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)

  
### Dataset: 

- **Description**: 736 data points from a public mental health survey, with respondents from diverse age ranges and regions.
- **Survey Structure**:
  - Part 1: General background questions about the responders and their music habits.
  - Part 2: Frequency of listening to given music genres.
  - Part 3: Mental Health conditions
